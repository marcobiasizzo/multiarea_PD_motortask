# Motor task execution in different dopamine depletion scenarios
The following GIFs show the motor task execution in different dopamine depletion scenarios (from -0.1, mild Parkinson's disease (PD), to -0.8, severe PD).

The desired trajectory (shadow purple) goes from 0 to \pi/4 with minimum jerk.
The movement is generated by the sum of two torques:
- The inverse model force, modulated by cortex average activity,
- The output of a cerebellar controller

The research was carried out at NearLab (Politecnico di Milano), with the collaboration of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and University of Pisa.
