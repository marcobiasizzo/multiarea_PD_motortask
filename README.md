# Motor task execution in different dopamine depletion scenarios
The following GIF shows the motor task execution in different dopamine depletion scenarios, from -0.1 (mild Parkinson's disease (PD)), to -0.8 (severe PD):

The desired trajectory (shadowed purple) goes from 0 to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ in 1 second, with minimum jerk.  

The movement is generated by the sum of two torques:
1. The inverse model torque, modulated by cortex average activity;
2. The output of a cerebellar controller, which learns to correct the first torque.

From mild to severe PD scenarios, we register:
- Worse performance in task execution, with an increase of the root mean square error of both position and velocity;
- Slower learning, with more trials required to reach the perforamce plateau.

The research was carried out at NearLab (Politecnico di Milano), in collaboration with Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and University of Pisa.
